### 2. Clone the Repository
In your terminal, clone the project repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SkyZeroA/SkyProjectGroup5.git


---

### 3. Navigate to the Project Folder
Move into the cloned project directory:

```bash
cd your-repo-name

### 4. Start the Backend Server
While inside the main project folder, run the backend using Python:

```bash
python3 -m backend.app

‚ö†Ô∏è Ensure you are in the main project directory before running this command.
This will start the backend server on your local machine.

### 5. Open a New Terminal for the Frontend
Open another terminal window or tab, then navigate to the frontend folder:

```bash
cd react-frontend
