MVP GOAL:
Show a working prototype where:
- A user signs up.
- Completes a short onboarding questionnaire.
- Logs eco-friendly actions via an Eco Counter.
- Sees their Eco Score and a live leaderboard for the current week.

CORE FEATURES OF THE MVP:

User Management
- Minimal users table (email, name).
- No complex auth for MVP (just store user info).

Questionnaire
- One active questionnaire version.
- A few questions (e.g., commute mode, diet type, reusable habits).
- Options for single-choice questions.
- Store user responses.

Eco Actions
- Predefined list of actions (e.g., “Cycle to work”, “Vegetarian meal”).
- Each action has points per unit and CO₂e saved per unit.

Eco Counter
- Users log actions (+/− with quantity).
- Points and CO₂ impact calculated in the app and stored in user_action_log.

Leaderboard
- Live view for current week (computed from logs).
- Shows top users by Eco Score.

USER FLOW IN MVP:
- Sign up → insert into users.
- Onboarding questionnaire → fetch questions from questionnaire_questions and questionnaire_options, store answers in user_responses.
- Eco Counter → fetch eco_actions, user logs actions → insert into user_action_log.
- Leaderboard → query a view that sums points_delta for current wee- k.
